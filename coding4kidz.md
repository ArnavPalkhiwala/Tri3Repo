Coding4kidz is an organization that is leading the next generation of future computer science students. Enabling them into the evolving world of computer science, opening their horizons to apply to code to real life applications, coding4kidz is making a stamp for the future. These kids are not yet in high school, meaning they have not yet received the opportunity to learn coding at school. We hope to be the passing torch of innovation towards this next generation.
